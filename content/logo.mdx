    # Logo Guidelines
    
    Our logo represents the brand identity and should be used consistently across all materials. Follow these guidelines to maintain brand integrity.
    
    ## Clear Space
    
    Always maintain adequate clear space around the logo. The minimum clear space is equal to the height of the "A" in the logo.
    
    ## Minimum Size
    
    The logo should never be reproduced smaller than 24px in height for digital applications or 10mm for print.
